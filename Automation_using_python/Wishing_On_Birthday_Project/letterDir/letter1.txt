Dear [name], 

Happiest birthday, closest companion! I need to wish you exceptionally warm congrats on your very special day and offer me all the best for the same, a lot increasingly incredible birthdays to come in your future. 

I trust this specific birthday is the best one ever for you. Knowing you, you most likely have a rundown of energizing things wanted to do this year so as to praise it with your superb family. 

Remember this: while everyone proceeds to grow old, not every person grows up! Sounds like me and you, isn’t that so? At whatever point I have to place a speedy grin all over, I simply consider all the great occasions we’ve shared.

You look as youthful and delightful as the primary day I met you. Did you find the ‘wellspring of youth’? 

Likewise, I need to thank you for being there for me this previous year when I truly required assistance. In any case, that is the thing that companions are for, and you’re amazing. It would be ideal if you realize that I will consistently be there for you as well. 

Here’s to wishing you a long, sound, and prosperous life my companion! 

Once more, upbeat birthday.

Love,

Nerdy boy
