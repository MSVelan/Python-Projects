My Dear [name],

As we today celebrate your birthday, I’m overjoyed and don’t know where to begin. There’s a lot I want as I celebrate you on your special day that can’t fit into this letter. Therefore, let me start by declaring the most obvious fact: you’re my best friend in this world.

From the moment we met each other, we’ve always gotten along very fine, and it’s as though you’re the perfect piece to my puzzle. This is not to say that something was missing, but just that you made me become a better version of myself by constantly motivating me. Although you most probably are bursting in laughter thinking I’m super corny, just know this is true.

Yours Truly,

Nerdy boy
