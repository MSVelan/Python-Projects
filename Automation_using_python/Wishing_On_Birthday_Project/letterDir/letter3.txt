Hi [name],

Happy birthday! I hope this email finds you well.

It's been a while since we've seen each other and I'm really sorry for that. I hope you're doing great and that life is treating you well.

I wanted to take a moment to write you a letter and tell you how much your friendship means to me. It's hard to put into words, but having you in my life has made it so much richer. You've been there for me through thick and thin, and I can't thank you enough for that.

I don't know what the future holds, but I know that no matter what happens, I'll always cherish our friendship. Happy birthday

Yours truly,

Nerdy boy
